# 🛡️ Biometric Identity & Signal Research Lab (2026)

**Biometric Identity & Signal Research Lab** is a documentation-centric repository focused on understanding and evaluating biometric systems, media-signal manipulation techniques, and their implications for modern fintech identity verification (IDV). The emphasis is on *education, threat modeling, and defense strategies* — not on creating harmful tools.

This project uses simulated signal vectors and analytical write-ups to help developers, auditors, and security professionals improve the reliability of authentication systems.

## 🧠 What is DFK?

**DFK** stands for **Deepfake Framework Kit** — an academic term used here to describe a *testing framework* for evaluating the fidelity and detection resistance of media-based identities. In the context of this repository, DFK refers to structured resources and logic models used for:

- Real-time media synthesis analysis
- Benchmarking voice and video pattern fidelity
- Studying how biometric gateways classify synthetic signals

> **Note:** DFK is included for *defensive research and simulation* to help improve detection and mitigation strategies. No malicious intent is supported.
